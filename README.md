Week One Assignment

It was a bit frustrating learning the structure of the application. I couldn't quite visualize how everything plugs together yet and what it's job is compared to other languages I know. 

Typing and how to call methods or set Methods is still a bit fuzzy for me and this is likely because I'm still getting used the documentation and how things work together.

The logic parts are easy so far and how they map to UI elements makes sense. I just got caught up on conversions and have to try everything under the sun before finding a suitable structure and using the correct syntax.

I would just like to better understand how I can create a method that my IBAction methods can call that better optimize my code to just check for a null and then do the conversion. I've tried this but haven't been able to scope it correctly. What is a simple implementation of this type of interaction / communication?

I would also like to see how to best setup two different Speech Synthesizers as well as using NSRange to select and replace a piece of text in a textField.
